His most important compositions are his keyboardworks, which include about 70 solo sonatas as well as sonatinasand variations. During a continental tour as a solo pianist in theearly 1780s, he stayed in Vienna for six months, taking part ina famous piano contest with Mozart. Afterwards, Mozart commentedon his ‘remarkable technique at the keyboard’. In 1798Clementi established a firm in London that not only publishedmusic but also manufactured pianos.
